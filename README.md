SongSpace
=========

Fly about the globe and listen to it's music.
[See project live.](http://dijitalelefan.com/songspace/)


Leveraging the power of the [EchoNest API](http://the.echonest.com/) 
for discovering music, the [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/) for playing music, 
and the [WebGL Earth JavaScript API](http://www.webglearth.org/) (which, in turn, uses [CesiumJS](http://cesiumjs.org/))
for displaying the globe, I made this project to explore the world and the music within it.

TODO:
    * Playlists (from song, from artist, from location?)
    * Audio Visualization
    * More information on artist
    * Alternative sorting (currently only by "hotttnesss")
